This blog is a starting point, and it can be a finishing point as well.
I could write about things I start learning or I have already learned.
For sure, I'm going to write because it helps me to remember.

Mostly, I write about tech, from time to time about something else.
The preeminent challenge is to start the blog; the consequential challenge is to keep going.
