## What about me?

A very long time ago, a future rockstar tech guy was born... was not me but [Kyle Simpson](https://twitter.com/getify 'go to Kyle Simposon twitter profile') ... and after some time, I managed to arrive in this world and my story started from that point in history.

I was born in a city called Bari in the south of Italy in a region called Puglia. When I was 8 years old, my parents and I decided to move to Rimini from Gravina in Puglia. We moved not because there was no work for them there, but due to the slow internet connection.

If you have managed to read until this line, well done, you are very interested in my life. Thank you for that, but I will stop talking about it. I am sorry but my biography will be out soon, [let's keep in touch.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicolantonio-vignola/ 'Nico Vignola LinkedIn profile')

Let us stay focussed on what matters. My real name is Nicolantonio but if you can't deal with it, Nico is more than fine.

## What about this blog?

Do you know about [the ghost who code](https://www.troyhunt.com/the-ghost-who-codes-how-anonymity-is/ 'The Ghost Who Code article') ? Well, that answers the why of this blog. I strongly suggest reading that article... strongly.

I wasn't aware of coding ghosts and mainly I didn't know that I was one of them. Is not only about the career but is more about giving back to the community. I don't know too much, I don't have the truth in my hands but I'll try to share what I know and especially what I don't know.

This blog is also for me, my selfish, healthy part. Since I can't retain much information in my head I will put it here.

So that is it, you can go back to whatever brought you here.
